# Acceptance criteria — FitFindr

Five criteria that say what "working" means for this agent, written in unit 3
**before** any results existed.

An acceptance criterion names a target: a number, a count, a rate, or something
a person could plainly observe. *"The agent handles errors"* is an opinion.
*"When search returns nothing, the agent stops before calling the second tool,
in 5 of 5 tries"* is a criterion.

Under each one, write a sentence or two on **why that target** and not a
stricter one. A reason that says something about your tools, your loop, or the
data earns credit; *"80% seemed reasonable"* does not.

> Missing your own targets next unit costs you nothing. Setting a target so
> easy you can't miss it does.

**Two are written for you. You write three.**

## 1. A matching query completes all three tools

Given a query that matches at least one listing, the agent completes all three
tool calls and returns a fit card — in at least 4 of 5 tries.

**Why this target:**
<!-- Why 4 of 5 and not 5 of 5? Something about your search, probably —
     "my search is a plain keyword match and some phrasings will miss" is a
     real answer. -->
My searching algorithm is a simple keyword match and some phrases are possible 
to miss if not exact, but most should be caught. 

---

## 2. An impossible query stops before the second tool

Given a query that matches no listings, the agent stops before calling
`suggest_outfit` and returns a message naming what to change — 5 of 5 tries.

**Why this target:**
<!-- Why is 5 of 5 reasonable here when criterion 1 isn't? What's different
     about this path? -->

`suggest_outfit` requires an item listing as the input. Because of this, if 
the query matches no listings, the agent will not be able to continue and 
should branch off always.

## 3. Something about state

<!-- YOU WRITE THIS ONE.

     How would you know that the item your search found is the same item the
     next tool received? Name something countable or observable.

     This is the criterion people find hardest, because state failure doesn't
     look like state failure — it looks like a tool problem. Something that
     compares session["selected_item"] against what actually reached
     suggest_outfit is the shape you're after. -->

For 5 different queries that each match at least one listing, the listing id
in session["selected_item"] is the same as the id of the item that
suggest_outfit receives, in 5 of 5 runs. This is checked by printing both ids at the
end of each run.

**Why this target:**
Since `suggest_outfit` takes in the selected item, we expect the id for the 
listings to match. If not, there is something wrong.

---

## 4. Something about the fit card

<!-- YOU WRITE THIS ONE.

     The fit card calls a model, so the same input can produce different words
     each time. That's not a bug — it's the nature of the tool. So what would
     make it acceptable?

     Think about what you'd actually be unhappy to see. A caption that never
     mentions the price? Two different items producing the same opening
     sentence? A card longer than a caption anyone would post? Any of those can
     be turned into a number. -->

For 5 different queries that each match at least one listing, the fit card
contains all three of the following, in at least 4 of 5 runs:
- the item's price (e.g. "18", "18.0"), with or without "$"
- the item's platform, ignoring case
- at least one word from the item's title or style_tags, ignoring case

Checked by a script that searches each card's text for all three.

**Why this target:**
Since these are three conditions that must be met, it is possible for some to 
not be met and therefore failing the condition. However, in a meaningful caption,
we want all to be present. If not, this should fail and be fine tuned.

---

## 5. Your choice

<!-- YOU WRITE THIS ONE TOO.

     Pick something you actually care about getting right. Speed, the empty
     wardrobe path, what happens when the model can't be reached, whether the
     search respects a price ceiling — anything, as long as it names a number
     or an observable outcome. -->

For 5 different queries that each match at least one listing and each state
a price ceiling as "under $N", "less than $N", "below $N", or "max $N", every
listing in session["search_results"] has a price at or below N, in 5 of 5 runs.

**Why this target:**
The price ceiling in an intentional setting that the user sets. The model should
respect this every time.

     UNIT 4 — read this before you change anything above.

     If a criterion turns out to be BROKEN rather than merely unmet, you can
     revise it, and that earns credit. But never delete or edit the original
     line. Add the revision underneath it, like this:

         ## 4. Something about the fit card

         The fit card is different every time.

         **Why this target:** ...

         > **Revised in unit 4:** For 5 different items, the 5 fit cards share
         > no opening sentence.
         >
         > **Why revised:** "different" wasn't checkable — two cards that
         > differed by one word still counted. The new version is something I
         > can actually score.

     That's a revision because the criterion couldn't be MEASURED.

     Lowering a target because you missed it is not a revision, and it costs
     you the point:

         ✗ "I said the empty search stops it 5 of 5 times, but I got 3 of 5,
            so 3 of 5 is more realistic."

     A number you missed stays where it is, gets diagnosed, and gets a fix
     attempted. That's where the points are.
